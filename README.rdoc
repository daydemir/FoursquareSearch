This project is for me to try a few different things.

First: Connecting to the Foursquare API and searching nearby venues

Second: Implementing custom gesture reognizer for long press menu

Third: Implementing gesture recognizer to allow double tap and pan zooming on MKMapView (similar to how Google Maps uses this gesture) 

And any other ideas as they come...
